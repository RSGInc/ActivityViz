# ActivityViz 
ActivityViz is an interactive travel and activity data visualization tool.  It is built with JavaScript 
and HTML technologies and works with various types of travel and activity data - household travel surveys, trip-based
model outputs, activity-based model outputs, disaggregate passive data, etc.  The dashboard features several 
interactive and customizable visualizations for exploring data, such as 3D maps of 
trips in time and space, time use by person type and activity, radar charts for performance measure analysis, 
sunburst diagrams for visualizing mode shares, and animated bubble maps.  ActivityViz is published using GitHub 
pages which eliminates most of the administrative backend in traditional systems.  This improved deployment 
strategy makes maintenance much easier for the modeling staff.

ActivityViz was initially funded by the [Atlanta Regional Commission](https://atlantaregional.org/) (ARC).  

## Collaborating on this Project
1. The master branch is the release / stable version, the develop branch is for development, and gh-pages is the current published demo
2. To make contributions, fork the repo, make revisions, and issue a pull request to develop.
3. Once contributions are acceptable, then we will merge develop to master and then master to gh-pages

# Adding a New Region or New Scenario Data
ActivityViz supports configuration for multiple regions.  To setup ActivityViz in your region, fork this repository
to your GitHub account and then remove the existing configured region folders in the data folder.  Next, add your
region by doing the following:

1. Add the region name and properties in the config.json file.  Delete the other existing regions if desired.
2. Add a new region folder in the data folder. For example: The region "atlanta" should have a folder named "atlanta" in the data folder.  
3. The first region with the property "default" set to true will determine which graphics are shown on the main page.
4. Copy existing region.json file into the region folder.

## Adding New Scenario Data
Each region supports data for multiple scenarios.  Do the following to add scenario data:

1. Create a new folder in the region specific folder with the scenario name
2. Copy in the data tables that supply the data for the visualizations, each with the following set of fields:
  - BarChartAndMapData.csv: ZONE, COUNTY, <BAR_LABEL>, QUANTITY  
  - TimeUseData.csv: GROUP, TIME PERIOD, PURPOSE, QUANTITY
  - 3DAnimatedMapData.csv: ZONE, PERIOD, QUANTITY
  - TreeMapData.csv: GROUP1, GROUP2, GROUP3, ..., QUANTITY
  - RadarChartsData.csv: AXIS, CHART, <QUANTITY_1_LABEL>, <QUANTITY_2_LABEL>, ...
  - BarChartData.csv: BARGROUP, COLUMNS, QUANTITY, CHART 
  - ChordData.csv: FROM, TO, <QUANTITY_1_LABEL>, <QUANTITY_2_LABEL>, ... 
  - Scatter.csv: LABEL, XAXIS, YAXIS, SIZE (YAXIS/XAXIS)

Notes: 
  - All data tables are not required and each data table is used to populate a specific visual.  Take 
a look at the example data tables to see how each visual is constructed based on the data.  Most of the 
visuals are populated based by what is in the data tables, thereby making the visuals highly customizable.  
  - The PERIOD entries for TimeUse and 3DAnimatedMap are 1 to 48 and represent 30 minute periods from 3am to 3am the next day.  
  - The TimeUse purposes must be ALLCAPS and must include atleast HOME, WORK, SCHOOL.  TimeUse must also include an ALL person types.

## Data/Region Folder
